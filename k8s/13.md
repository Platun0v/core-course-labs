## Content of file in volumes

```bash
platun0v-pc 3$ ➜ kubectl exec pod/python-app-0 -- cat /app/data/visits_data.json
{"visited_count":43}⏎                                                                                                                                              
platun0v-pc 3$ ➜ kubectl exec pod/python-app-1 -- cat /app/data/visits_data.json
{"visited_count":30}⏎                                                                                                                                              
platun0v-pc 3$ ➜ kubectl exec pod/python-app-2 -- cat /app/data/visits_data.json
{"visited_count":32}⏎
```

Content of files is different, because we access to different pods, and each pod has own volume. Also, data in files will persist after restart of pods, because we use PersistentVolumeClaim.

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.

We don't need ordering guarantees, because we don't have any dependencies between pods. Each pod has own volume, and we don't need to share data between pods.

## Implement a way to instruct the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.

We can use `PodManagementPolicy` for this. It can be `OrderedReady` or `Parallel`. By default it is `OrderedReady`. I've changed it to `Parallel` in `values.yaml` file.

## Explore Update Strategies:

### Rolling Strategy

RollingUpdate is the default update strategy for StatefulSets. It ensures that only one Pod is updated at a time. The update starts by updating the Pod with the revision 1, then moving on to the Pod with the revision 2, and so on, until all Pods are updated with the latest version.

### Recreate Strategy

Recreate is another update strategy for StatefulSets. It deletes all the Pods in the StatefulSet, and then creates new Pods with the updated configuration. This strategy is useful when you want to perform some operations on the StatefulSet that require all Pods to be deleted, such as changing the Pod template or deleting the StatefulSet itself.

### Canaries Strategy

Canary updates are a pattern for rolling out releases to a subset of users or servers. The idea is to first deploy the change to a small subset of servers, test it, and then roll the change out to the rest of the servers. This strategy is useful when you want to test the new version of your application before rolling it out to all the users.
